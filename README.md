# IP Address Tracker  

This is a 1.5 day build project built upon design specifications from [FrontEndMentor's ip-address-tracker intermediate difficulty challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) but slightly modified.  
All images used are from FrontEndMentor.  
Project uses React.js, Typescript, [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/), [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/), [Public-IP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/public-ip)  
CSS will be cleaned and re-uploaded in the next week.  
  
To start this project, clone the repository and run `yarn start`. I will provide an API key for ease of use as this is just a demo - please don't go overboard with requests.  
  
  
Due to what appear to be CORS issues with github pages and geo.ipify.org, there will not be a live demo for this site.  
The application will still work if you clone the repository.
